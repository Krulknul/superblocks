# Superblocks

### Try it out [here](https://superblocks.vercel.app)

Superblocks is a tool that any user in the Radix ecosystem can use to compose together the functionality of multiple dApps.

Radix DLT, as a project, has a large focus on scaling without sacrificing atomic composability. This atomic composability feature seems very technical, but its presence (or lack thereof in other networks) directly affects the things users can do on any network. With composability, developers can write applications that can compose different types of operations like staking, lending, swapping and many more. The Radix transaction manifest enables developers to implement these kinds of dapps. It's an awesome technology, but it's not fit to directly use for most users, as it's difficult to read and write for non-coders.

Superblocks brings that power to the users, by giving them access to easily composable "blocks", which represent the functionalities of different dApps. Users can simply drag and drop multiple "blocks" into their transaction and fill in the blanks. Superblocks will calculate the intermediate results at each step of the transaction. This allows users to easily fill in the next block at any point in a long transaction of which you usually might not know the intermediate outcomes upfront.

To make integrations with new dApps easy, superblocks adopts a standard definition for "blocks", and may eventually allow any dApp to write a custom integration so that their dApp can be used on Superblocks.

# How to run

To run the application, move into frontend, have node 20, run npm install and then npm run dev.

# Superblocks is WORK IN PROGRESS
Superblocks was my submission for the Hackathon at the European Blockchain Convention 2024 in Barcelona, and the first version was built in 2 days.

## The following recordings were part of my EBC Barcelona 2024 Hackathon submission
They were filmed in a noisy convention hall on a time crunch, just FYI
